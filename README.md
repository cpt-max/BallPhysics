# Ball Physics demo

Simple Unity ball physics demo, without using a physics engine or Unity colliders.<br>
Balls collide with other balls, as well as static triangle meshes.<br>
Performance ain't great, due to lack of space partitioning for objects or mesh triangles. It's brute force collision checks for now.

Simulated ball properties:
- radius
- mass 
- elasticity 
- air drag (linear and rotational)
- magnus effect (lift on spinning ball)
- surface friction
