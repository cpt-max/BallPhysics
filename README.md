# Ball Physics demo

Simple Unity ball physics demo, without using a physics engine or Unity colliders.<br>
Balls collide with other balls and static triangle meshes.<br>
Several things are still dodgy.
Performance ain't great, due to lack of space partitioning for objects or mesh triangles.

Simulated ball properties:
- radius
- mass 
- elasticity 
- air drag (translational and rotational)
- magnus effect (lift on spinning ball)
- surface friction (dodgy)
